## Overview
The problem domain we are analyzing is publicly available information about different cities' Airbnb listings data. Currently, our repo uses three Airbnb listing datasets: Boston, Chicago, and Singapore. Each dataset includes a diverse array of information about individual listings, with features such as host response rate, review score, accommodations, locations, etc. Because each city's dataset contains the same features (and therefore mostly the same information), we may not end up analyzing all three dataset equally in this exploratory analysis.

### Top 10 Neighborhoods in Singapore by Listing
This chart was intended to show the most common neighborhoods for Airbnb listings in Singapore by frequency:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
listings_plot
```

The above chart reveals that the top neighborhood by a large margin, is Kallang. Interestingly, the top 10 neighborhoods for Airbnb listings (as shown here) hardly match up with the top 10 most populous neighborhoods in Singapore. This could be an indication that the neighborhoods where many local Singaporeans actually live tend to be distinct from the neighborhoods that tourists (Such as Airbnb customers) stay in.
