## Domain of Interest
###identify a domain that you are interested in

Airbnb Listings / Real Estate data in different city locations.

#### Why are you interested in this field/domain?

We're interested in comparing Airbnb listings across different locations. Particularly we want to see how different holidays in different countries/locations impact number of listings for example.
If we were to travel (after COVID pandemic) it could be useful to understand listing information such as price changes. Additionally, the data could reveal information on how to become a more successful Airbnb host for those of us that are interested in becoming one in the future.
